Here I will put all the material I use for teaching.
For now, it is just a list of useful links!

## Technical tools
* [Guide](/post/remote_editing) to how to develop on remote hosts
* Very easy [introduction](/post/git_intro) to git
* A full [interactive tutorial](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=it_IT) about git
* When git is a [mess](http://justinhileman.info/article/git-pretty/)
* If you need a review of any technology, check [this](https://learnxinyminutes.com)

## Neural Networks and Machine Learning
* A very good [university course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUenpfvlyoa0rMoE5nXA8kdctBKE9eSob) on machine learning
* The [_deep learning book_](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/). A must if you want to use neural networks.
* An awesome explanation of [backpropagation](https://medium.com/@14prakash/back-propagation-is-very-simple-who-made-it-complicated-97b794c97e5c)
* A tool to visualize [how nn learn](http://www.emergentmind.com/neural-network) (check input and output)
* Another tool to study [how and what nn are learning](https://playground.tensorflow.org)
* Resources to understand convolutions and transposed convolutions: [vdumoulin](https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic), [ezyang](https://ezyang.github.io/convolution-visualizer/index.html)
* A nice paper to understand [LSTM networks](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)
* Understanding [update algorithms](https://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/index.html)
