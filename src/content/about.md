Hi! I am Federico and this is my little website, where I try to merge various
activities otherwise dispersed all around the web. I am a post-doc researcher
at Instituto Complutense de Ciencias Musicales - ICCMU in the Didone
[project](//didone.eu), where I work on the expression of emotions in the 18th
century Italian Opera. 

I have taken my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Milan in the
[LIM - Music Informatics Laboratory](http://www.lim.di.unimi.it/), where I
studied computational methods for music performance analysis. While I am
continuously involved in researching new tools for music/audio analysis and
synthesis, I want to contribute to the improvement of the society and of the
world in which we live.
