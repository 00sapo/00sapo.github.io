Hi! I am Federico and this is my little website, where I try to merge various activities otherwise dispersed all around the web. I am going to work at the Complutense University in the Didone [project](//didone.eu). I have taken my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Milan in the [LIM - Music Informatics Laboratory](http://www.lim.di.unimi.it/), where I studied computational methods for music performance analysis. While I am continuously involved in researching new tools for music expressivity, I want to contribute to the improvement of the society and of the world in which we live.
