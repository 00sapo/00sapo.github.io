*One day I will write why all software I produce is released with free license, where free is like in speech, not like in beer...*

All my software and research code is available online. You can mainly find my
codes in my [github account](https://github.com/00sapo/) and in the links
inside my [publications](/publications).

However, some of the code I develop is under different github accounts (organizations):

* [github.com/LIMUNIMI](https://github.com/limunimi/)
* [github.com/DIDONEproject](https://github.com/DIDONEproject/)


## Have a Look at these

### WikiCFP - GGS

It also adds links to SJR and Google Scholar queries. A must for researchers in computer science.
