I am a post-doc researcher in the [Laudare ERC project](https://laudare.eu) at the GSSI - Gran Sasso Science
Institute. I am also a research collaborator at the University of Milan, in the LIM -
Music Informatics Laboratory. Previously, I was a post-doc researcher
at the Instituto Complutense de Ciencias Musicales - ICCMU in the [Didone
project](//didone.eu), where I worked on the 18th
century Italian Opera.

I have taken my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Milan in the
[LIM - Music Informatics Laboratory](http://www.lim.di.unimi.it/), where I
studied computational methods for music performance analysis. While I am
continuously involved in researching new tools for enabling access to music/culture
fruition/production, I want to contribute to the improvement of the society and of the
world in which we live.
